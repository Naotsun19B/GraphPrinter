## Description

This plugin adds a shortcut key that prints an Unreal Engine graph editor (such as Blueprint or Material ...) to an image file or copies it to the clipboard.
As shown in the image below, you can also output the part that is not displayed in the graph editor to the image file.
You can also restore the node from the output png format image file.
